# Hardware components for laptop installation
# Partitioning Instructions

Acquire the following :

-------
* Laptop
* Arch Installation File, x86_64 bit
* 8GB or greater USB
* Ethernet Cable and internet connection
* Spare Linux computer with USB slot, network capabilities
  (Ubuntu is easy installation, decently user-friendly)
--------

# Flash Arch image to USB
# Configure BIOS (F2 at startup in my case) to boot from USB
# Plug in Arch Live USB, boot from USB on startup. 

# In Shell, type the following (replace the sdX with whatever drive it is, probably gonna be sda):
parted /dev/sdX 
    mklabel msdos
    yes
    mkpart part-type fs-type start end
    mkpart primary ext4 1MiB 109 GiB
    set 1 boot on
    mkpart primary linux-swap 109GiB 100%
    # Creates and sizes partitions
lsblk
# Lists partitions
    
mkfs.ext4 /dev/sdxY
# probably sda1
# Formats to ext4
     
mkswap /dev/sdxY
# probably sda2
swapon /dev/sdxY
# sda2
# Makes the swap partition

mount /dev/sda1 /mnt
# Mounts partition to root folder
    
mkdir /mnt/boot
mount /dev/sda2 /mnt/boot
# Makes the boot partition

# Generate a partitioning filescheme: 
genfstab -U /mnt >> /mnt/etc/fstab

# Connect the laptop to the internet using an ethernet cable.
# Install the base packages:
pacstrap -i /mnt base base-devel grub os-prober dialog wpa_supplicant


# Allow the system to boot to Arch instead of requiring the USB:
arch-chroot /mnt /bin/bash

shutdown -h now
# Shutdown the computer, remove the USB, and install the system packages. The base install is done.
